# Hobby projects involving a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers
The purpose of this hobby project is to learn how to learn about several subjects within computing, networking and application development by defining mini-projects and working on these. The base for these mini-projects will be a computer-cluster consisting of raspberry Pi computers.

Some things I want to experiment with are:
- set up a kubernetes environment
- set up means of monitoring/managing the kube environment
- Setting up a web application for multiple purposes
  - pull API info for buses, weather
  - Build IoT sensors and devices and connect these

I will be using this document to log my progress and learnings. If there are any readers, feel free to interact by leaving comments or getting in touch through some other media. 

The style of the log will be irregular updates as I do stuff. I will most likely post a lot of questions, which will mostly serve as questions asked to myself, to be answered at a later point in time. There isnt really a long term end goal for this project, but rather short term mini projects.
